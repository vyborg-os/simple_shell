.SH DESCRIPTION
A shell, in the context of UNIX, refers to an interactive user interface with an operating system, often known as a command interpreter. It serves as a software layer responsible for understanding and executing user-entered commands, typically adhering to a specific syntax.

.B Overview

The simple shell is a command-line utility that reads input lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and carries out various system commands. It's the program that initiates when a user logs into the system. The simple shell has been crafted to support both interactive usage and script execution. Users can directly input commands into the running shell or create script files that can be executed by the shell.
